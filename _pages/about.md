Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the Department of Economics, Business School of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology .

My research focuses on econometric theory, applied econometrics, machine learning, and high-dimensional statistics. I am particularly interested in developing estimation and inference tools that use the predictive power of AI while maintaining the causal interpretation that is essential for economic analysis.

I am on the 2025-2026 job market and welcome discussions about my research！
